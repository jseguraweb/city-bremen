            Bremen's first train station was opened in 1847 on the site of today's station, on the line to Hanover.

            Maybe you visit the city in a Bundesliga weekend and Werder is playing home. I definitely recommend you to
            watch a match there. The atmosphere will amaze you. And luckily they even win a match…

            Night is young, so take a walk in Viertel and mix with the most hipster neighborhood in the city. If you
            still have power, there are some cool discos to visit.
